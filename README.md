# Vanuatu Market Survey[RAP]&nbsp;

## Develop by David & Julio(linda)

The Port Vila Central Market Survey summarises selected agricultural produces sold at the main wet market based on the

of commodities and the average price increased by 20 percent compared to the previous quarter.

The volume of all commodities increased in this quarter compared to the previous quarter and this is attributed to
